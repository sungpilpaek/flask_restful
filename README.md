# Flask Restful

Author: Sung-Pil Paek

Welcome to my Github portfolio! Just like many other developers, I certainly like to express myself by showing how I code. In our world, an ability to write clean, testable, and maintainable code is undoubtedly one of the most important fundamentals to possess. Hence, I display one of my projects implemented in Python and flask_restful. It starts with running a web application in localhost. With client's HTTP requests, the web app performs CRUD transactions and returns data if needed.

Finally, please note that this document is written based on Windows.

## Prerequisites

First of all, it is recommended to install virtualenv which you can easily do so by using pip.
```
pip install virtualenv
```
Once you have installed, head to custom folder and create your own environment.
```
cd path\to\custom\folder
mkdir myproject
virtualenv myproject
```
Now that you have your fresh and new environment, the only last thing to do is to activate it.
```
cd myproject
Scripts\activate
```
For your information, you can turn off the mode by typing below command.
```
Scripts\deactivate
```
