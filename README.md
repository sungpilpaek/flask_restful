# flask_restul

Author: Sung-Pil Paek

Welcome to my portfolio Github! Just like many other developers, I certainly like to express myself by showing how I code. In our world, an ability to write clean, testable, and maintainable code is undoubtedly one of the most important fundamentals to possess.

Hence, I display one of my projects implemented in Python and flask_restful. It starts with running a web application in localhost. With client's HTTP requests, the web app performs CRUD transactions and returns data if needed.
