# Flask-Restful

Welcome to my Github portfolio!

Just like many other developers, I certainly like to express myself by showing how I code and refactor modules. In our world, an ability to write clean, testable, and maintainable code is undoubtedly one of the most important fundamentals to possess. Hence, I would like to display one of my projects implemented in Python and flask_restful.

Please note that this document is written based on Windows.

EDIT [07-03-2017]
Added the API Template Generator in tools/ directory, which will enable us to easily write bulk codes.

EDIT [07-09-2017] Cross Origin Resouce Sharing

Implemented two origins communicating via W3C CORS standard. Below is a brief demo!
